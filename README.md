Ever since I started web development, I have always been fascinated with developer portfolio websites. I have found many inspiring ones, especially 3D portfolio sites. Since I am not (yet) proficient with ThreeJS, I haven't ventured into building one. However, I came across some original ones, including a VSCode-like clone, and I wanted to recreate it. This is the result of that effort. It's not perfect, and I needed to Google a lot, but I got it done, and I'm proud of that.
